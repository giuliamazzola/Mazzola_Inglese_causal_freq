# Replication materials for: Mazzola & Inglese, "Causalness, frequency, diachrony and the causal-noncausal alternation in Italian and Spanish" in *Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory*

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and figures necessary to document and partially reproduce the analyses reported in the paper:

> **Causalness, frequency, diachrony and the causal-noncausal alternation in Italian and Spanish**

[Full paper citation will be added after publication]

The repository is organized to ensure transparency and long-term accessibility of the materials used in the study. Due to the use of an external interactive tool, **full computational reproducibility is not possible**, but all analytical steps are documented in detail.

---

## Repository contents

* **R code**

  * A Quarto report (`.qmd`) containing the main analyses, tables, and figures presented in the paper
  * An additional R script (`.R`) implementing part of the analytical procedure that cannot be executed within Quarto
  
* **Data**

  * Input data files in `.xlsx` format
  * R.Data file to reproduce the R script


* **Figures**

  * Plots automatically generated by the Quarto document
  * Additional plots saved manually, produced by the standalone R script

## Reproducibility note (important)

Part of the analytical procedure relies on an interactive R-based application developed by Stefan Th., and Martin Hilpert, ' Variability-based neighbor clustering: A bottom-up approach to periodization in historical linguistics', in Terttu Nevalainen, and Elizabeth Closs Traugott (eds), The Oxford Handbook of the History of English (2012; online edn, Oxford Academic, 6 Nov. 2012), [link](https://doi-org.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199922765.013.0014]. This tool requires **manual user interaction** via a graphical interface and therefore **cannot be executed automatically or fully reproduced** in a scripted environment such as Quarto)

Specifically:

* The application is distributed as an `.RData` file
* The procedure requires the user to actively interact with the interface (e.g. clicking, selecting options)
* As a consequence, this step cannot be embedded in a fully automated workflow

For transparency, the outputs of this interactive step are:

* Documented in the accompanying `.R` script
* Saved and included in this repository
* Used as input for the subsequent analyses reported in the `.qmd` file

The original tool and detailed instructions are available at this [link](https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/static/companion.websites/nevalainen/Gries-Hilpert_web_final/vnc.individual.html](https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/static/companion.websites/nevalainen/Gries-Hilpert_web_final/vnc.individual.html)

## How to use this repository

### Requirements

* R (version ≥ 4.x recommended)
* RStudio (recommended)
* Quarto

All required R packages are loaded within the `.qmd` file. Missing packages can be installed manually if needed.

---

### Running the Quarto report

Open the `.qmd` file in RStudio and render it using Quarto. This will:

* Load the processed data
* Reproduce the main statistical analyses
* Regenerate all figures produced automatically

---

### Interactive step (non-automated)

To inspect or re-run the interactive part of the procedure:

1. Follow the VNC instructions provided by Gries & Hilpert (link above)
2. Load the provided `.RData` file as described in their documentation
3. Perform the required steps manually via the graphical interface
4. Compare the outputs with the saved results included in this repository

---

## Data availability

All data underlying the analyses reported in the paper are publicly available in this repository in `.xlsx` format. The data are provided in a form suitable for inspection and reanalysis.

A concise *Data Availability Statement* suitable for journal submission is provided in `DATA_AVAILABILITY.md`.
